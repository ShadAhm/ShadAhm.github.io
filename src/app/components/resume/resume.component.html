  <p>The term came into use around 1970, when the Four Asian Tigers[4] of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan
    rose to global prominence as NICs in the 1970s and 1980s, with exceptionally fast industrial growth since the 1960s;
    all four economies have since graduated into advanced economies and high-income economies. There is a clear
    distinction between these countries and the countries now considered NICs. In particular, the combination of an open
    political process, high GNI per capita, and a thriving, export-oriented economic policy has shown that these countries
    have now not only reached but surpassed the ranks of many developed countries.
  
    All four economies are classified as high-income economies by the World Bank and Advanced economies by the
    International Monetary Fund (IMF) and U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). All of them, like Western European
    countries, have a Human Development Index considered "very high" by the UN.</p>

  <p>NICs are countries whose economies have not yet reached a developed country's status but have, in a macroeconomic
    sense, outpaced their developing counterparts. Such countries are still considered developing nations and only differ
    from other developing nations in the rate at which an NIC's growth is much higher over a shorter allotted time period
    compared to other developing nations.[1][2] Another characterization of NICs is that of countries undergoing rapid
    economic growth (usually export-oriented). Incipient or ongoing industrialization is an important indicator of an NIC.
    In many NICs, social upheaval can occur as primarily rural, or agricultural, populations migrate to the cities, where
    the growth of manufacturing concerns and factories can draw many thousands of laborers. NIC's introduce many new
    immigrants looking to improve their social and or political status thorough newly formed democracy's and increase in
    wages that most individuals who partake in such changes would obtain.[3]</p>
  
  <h2 id="h2Employment">Employment History</h2>
  <p>NICs usually benefit from comparatively low wage costs, which translates into lower input prices for suppliers. As a
    result, it is often easier for producers in NICs to outperform and outproduce factories in developed countries, where
    the cost of living is higher, and trade unions and other organizations have more political sway. This comparative
    advantage is often criticized by advocates of the fair trade movement.
  
    Critics of NICs argue economic freedom is not always associated with political freedom in countries such as China,
    pointing out that Internet censorship and human rights violations are common.[22] The case is diametrically opposite
    for India; While being a liberal democracy throughout after its independence[citation needed], India has been widely
    criticized for its inefficient, bureaucratic governance and slow process of structural reform. Thus, while political
    freedom in China remains limited, the average Chinese citizen enjoys a higher standard of living than his or her
    counterpart in India.[23]</p>

  <p>The idea of categorizing countries by their economic and developmental status began during the Cold War with the
    classifications of East and West. The Soviet Union and China represented the East, and the United States and their
    allies represented the West. The term 'Third World' came into parlance in the second half of the twentieth century. It
    originated in a 1952 article by Alfred Sauvy entitled "Trois Mondes, Une Plan√®te."[4] Early definitions of the Third
    World emphasized its exclusion from the East-West conflict of the Cold War as well as the ex-colonial status and
    poverty of the nations it comprised.[4] Efforts to mobilize the Third World as an autonomous political entity were
    undertaken. The 1955 Bandung Conference was an early meeting of Third World states in which an alternative to
    alignment with either the Eastern or Western Blocs was promoted.[4] Following this, the first Non-Aligned Summit was
    organized in 1961. Contemporaneously, a mode of economic criticism which separated the world economy into "core" and
    "periphery" was developed and given expression in a project for political reform which "moved the terms 'North' and
    'South' into the international political lexicon."[5] In 1973, the pursuit of a New International Economic Order which
    was to be negotiated between the North and South was initiated at the Non-Aligned Summit held in Algiers.[6] Also in
    1973, the oil embargo initiated by Arab OPEC countries as a result of the Yom Kippur War caused an increase in world
    oil prices, with prices continuing to rise throughout the decade.[7] This contributed to a worldwide recession which
    resulted in industrialized nations increasing economically protectionist policies and contributing less aid to the
    less developed countries of the South.[7] The slack was taken up by Western banks, which provided substantial loans to
    Third World countries.[8] However, many of these countries were not able to pay back their debt, which led the IMF to
    extend further loans to them on the condition that they undertake certain liberalizing reforms.[8] This policy, which
    came to be known as structural adjustment, and was institutionalized by International Financial Institutions (IFIs)
    and Western governments, represented a break from the Keynesian approach to foreign aid which had been the norm from
    the end of the Second World War.[8] After 1987, reports on the negative social impacts that structural adjustment
    policies had had on affected developing nations led IFIs to supplement structural adjustment policies with targeted
    anti-poverty projects.[9] Following the end of the Cold War and the break-up of the Soviet Union, some Second World
    countries joined the First World, and others joined the Third World. A new and simpler classification was needed. Use
    of the terms "North" and "South" became more widespread.</p>
